"Let's make infinite gold!"

Welcome to MidasProject3, 
the ultimate 1% tick prediction machine for cryptocurrency trading! 
Using Binance-Futures, this project helps you decide 
when to go long or short on various cryptocurrencies, 
aiming to capitalize on price movements.


Project Overview:

MidasProject3 is designed to predict whether the price of each cryptocurrency will rise or fall. 
It supports both long (for price increases) and short (for price decreases) trading strategies.

The repository is organized into folders named after each cryptocurrency. 
These folders contain sequentially numbered scripts 
which should be executed in order to develop and train the prediction models.


Getting Started:

    Install Dependencies: Ensure you have all necessary dependencies installed. Refer to requirements.txt for a complete list.
    Run the Scripts: Navigate to each cryptocurrency folder and run the scripts in numerical order to build your model.
    Test Your Predictions: After training, test the prediction models against real-time data to see how they perform.

Good luck, and happy trading!
